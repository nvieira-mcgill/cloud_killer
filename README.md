# cloud_killer
Software to attempt to remove the effects of cloud coverage from albedo maps of Earth using Markov chain Monte-Carlo methods. Developed under the supervision of Professor N. Cowan at McGill University from Jan-April 2019. Credit also goes to McGill students Elisa Jacquet and Juliette Geoffrion for their work on previous versions of this project.

# Modules you'll need 
This software makes use of certain modules you may not already have. These include:

netCDF4.Dataset -- For loading in the EPIC data.

emcee -- "The MCMC Hammer." Developed by D. Foreman-Mackey et al. Used for all of the Markov chain Monte-Carlo in these scripts.

corner -- Software used to produce the corner plots needed to understand MCMC results. Also developed by D. Foreman-Mackey.

cartopy -- Software for preparing all sorts of maps. Used here to plot albedo maps over an actual map of Earth. 

astropy (specifically, astropy.time.Time) -- Widely-used software for astrophysics-related programming. Just download the whole thing.
